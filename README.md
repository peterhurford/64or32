## [peterhurford.github.io/64or32](https://peterhurford.github.io/64or32)

A website and library to determine if your computer is 64-bit or 32-bit

* * *

The libraries provided in the repo come pre-minified for your ease of use.

If you are **using jQuery** on your project you can use the *slightly smaller* `64or32-jquery.min.js`.

If you are **not using jQuery** on your project, you can use the *lightly more performant* `64or32-no-jquery.min.js`.

* * *

#### How to use this library

* **Pick** one of the minified `.js` files as noted above and **save** it to your project
* **Link** to it at the bottom of your page with a script tag like so:
```javascript
<script src="64or32-no-jquery.min.js"></script>
```
or
```javascript
<script src="64or32-jquery.min.js"></script>
```
* **Add** one of these **classes** to any element on the page that you only want to be displayed if that architecture is detected:
 * `unknown`
 * `mobile`
 * `arch32`
 * `arch64`
* And finally, **add** this to your **CSS**
```css
/* Hide all Architecture specific HTML on page load */
.unknown,
.mobile,
.arch32,
.arch64 {
    display: none;
}

/* Only display the content if the JS added a matching class to the HTML tag */
html.unknown,
html.mobile,
html.arch32,
html.arch64,
html.unknown .unknown,
html.mobile .mobile,
html.arch32 .arch32,
html.arch64 .arch64 {
    display: block;
}
```

#### FAQ

**Q:** If that CSS is needed for this to work, why isn't the library adding it in automatically?  
**A:** Because if the user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, then the CSS will never load. It's safer to let developers choose what the CSS will do by default in case a user doesn't have JavaScript turned on.
